# Emotion Arc and Character Arc Analysis and Comparison in Fictional Narratives
The notebooks show the code to generate and visualise the Emotion Arcs and Character Arcs of Fictional Narratives for the novels found on Project Gutenberg. The novels used as the dataset are shown in the table below:

| Book ID | Title |
| --- | --- |
| [486](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/486) | Ozma of Oz |
| [420](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/420) | Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz |
| [485](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/485) | The Road to Oz |
| [956](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/956) | Tik-Tok of Oz |
| [957](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/957) | The Scarecrow of Oz |
| [958](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/958) | Rinkitink in Oz |
| [960](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/960) | The Tin Woodman of Oz |

## Emotion Arc
Emotion Arc generation was researched in Reagan and Dodds ([2016](https://doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-016-0093-1)). 

## Character Arc
The pipeline for Character Arc generation was researched in Brahman and Chaturvedi ([2020](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2010.06822)) and Elsner ([2012](https://aclanthology.org/E12-1065)). Information related to Named Entity and Coreference Resolution for resolving multiple entities was presented by Duval and De L ́es ́eleuc ([2020](10.13140/RG.2.2.13445.17128)).
